## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find Java implementations of common data structures. Each data structure is organized in its own package, making it easy to explore and use.

## Data Structures

Here are some of the data structures included:

1. **Linked List**: A collection of nodes where each node points to the next node.
2. **Stack**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure.
3. **Queue**: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure.
4. **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical structure with nodes having at most two children.
5. **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
6. **Hash Map**: A key-value store for efficient data retrieval.
7. ... (you can add more as needed)

## Usage

To use any of the data structures, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Java-Data-Structures.git`
2. Navigate to the specific data structure package (e.g., `linkedlist`, `stack`, etc.).
3. Explore the code and see how the data structure is implemented.
4. Use the data structure in your own projects by importing the relevant classes.

Feel free to contribute by adding more data structures or improving existing ones!
